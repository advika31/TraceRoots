## Round 2 Objective

The goal of Round 2 is to evolve TraceRoots from a herb authenticity platform into a broader trust infrastructure for fresh agricultural produce, while strengthening sustainability, surplus management, and real-world readiness.

Round 2 builds directly on what we implemented in Round 1 and extends the system toward fruits, vegetables, and perishable supply chains.

## Scope Expansion
Round 1 (Implemented)

Focus on Ayurvedic herbs

AI-based authenticity verification

Batch creation and lifecycle tracking

Blockchain-backed traceability

QR-based consumer transparency

Role-based dashboards (farmer, consumer, NGO, regulator)

Initial surplus tracking workflow

Round 2 (Current Expansion)

Inclusion of fruits (fresh & export-grade)

Inclusion of vegetables (leafy, root, seasonal)

Support for perishable produce

Quality and freshness tracking (in addition to authenticity)

Structured surplus donation ecosystem

Better positioning for export and regulatory workflows

This reflects a natural evolution, not a pivot.

 AI Enhancements in Round 2
1. Quality & Freshness Grading (Partially Implemented)

We have extended the AI layer beyond authenticity toward:

Detecting visible defects

Estimating quality from images

Basic freshness indicators

Categorizing produce suitability (local vs higher grade)

Planned refinements:

More accurate shelf-life estimation

Stronger grading models for export standards

Impact:

Reduced spoilage

Better pricing signals

Increased farmer value

2. Multi-Modal Verification (Partially Designed, Extensible)

Current implementation:

Image-based analysis

Metadata-based validation

Architecture already supports adding:

Sensor inputs (temperature, humidity)

Optional lab data

Periodic validation checkpoints

This makes the system extensible rather than theoretical.

❄️ Cold Chain & Logistics Intelligence (Early Stage)

Round 2 introduces awareness of post-harvest loss factors.

Currently supported conceptually and architecturally:

Logging of movement stages

Time-based quality decay tracking

Infrastructure ready for temperature/humidity data

Planned evolution:

Alerts for quality degradation

Cold-chain compliance logs

Spoilage risk indicators

Positioning:

Built to support cold chain intelligence as data becomes available.

## ♻️ Advanced Surplus Management (Partially Implemented)

Round 1 already supports:

Manual surplus marking

NGO visibility

Claiming and donation confirmation

On-chain donation proof

Round 2 enhancements underway:

Smarter surplus identification

Early declaration workflows

Geo-aware matching between donor and NGO

Better donation lifecycle tracking

Impact:

Reduced food waste

Faster redistribution

Higher transparency

## 💰 Incentive & Impact Layer (Prototype Level)

Currently implemented:

Impact recognition model

Token/incentive concept integrated into design

Dashboard visibility for contribution

Being refined in Round 2:

Linking incentives to:

Quality compliance

Early surplus declaration

Sustainable practices

This ensures incentives remain behavior-driven, not gamified noise.

## 🌱 Sustainability & ESG Integration (Foundational Layer Built)

Currently supported:

Batch-level traceability

Transparent origin tracking

Ethical supply chain visibility

Round 2 extensions:

Sustainability indicators per batch

Eco-score style metadata for consumers

Making sustainability visible through QR scan

This keeps sustainability embedded, not superficial.

## 🏛️ Regulatory & Export Readiness (Architecture-Aligned)

What is already aligned:

Immutable batch history

Audit-ready data

Regulator role built into the system

Transparent lifecycle records

What Round 2 moves toward:

Alignment with FSSAI-style food traceability

Export documentation workflows

Structured compliance metadata

Regulator-grade audit views

Positioning:

The system is architected for compliance, even if integrations are future-facing.

## ⚙️ Platform & Architecture Improvements
    Already implemented

    Modular roles (farmer, collector, processor, NGO, regulator, consumer)

    Separated on-chain vs off-chain architecture

    Scalable data model for multi-crop support

    QR-based public interface

    Strengthened in Round 2

    Cleaner role-based access

    More flexible data schema

    Better logging and traceability depth

    Stronger audit integrity
